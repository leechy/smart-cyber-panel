# smart-cyber-panel

Static markup for the Smart Cyber admin panel

This is a static HTML and CSS. It is not connected to any backend.

## Components

Different components are just HTML-elements with a class. Separated in the HTML files with comments about the usage of the component.

## CSS

Only unique classes are used. No IDs. No inline styles.

Naming of the classes follows the BEM-methodology: http://getbem.com/introduction/

CSS for all the components is in the same file for simplicity.

## JavaScript

Just a simple DOM-manipulation to show and hide the different components. No frameworks or libraries.
